# Wat? #
These are my dotfiles, there are many like it but these are mine

# Huh? #
They can be installed by running:

```
wget --no-check-certificate -O - https://raw.github.com/pcon/my-dotfiles/master/setup.sh | bash
```

This does assume you are running a yum based system and have access to root via sudo.
